Video Capture and Conversion Procedure
======================================

Placeholder page for now, but using:

Camtasia Recorder on Windows, set up capture RoyalTS application with tabs for ssh and web pages.

Set Camtasia to custom size of 1440x1024, which should result in terminal windows of 120x50.

Run the capture with 10 seconds of lead time showing script to run on clear screen, and then
let run 10 seconds after the end.

Use the F9 button to pause long-running operations, and F10 to pause without visible cursor movement.

Once capture is done, Produce immediately.

Save capture file as ${hostname}-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-${2-digit-sequence}-${scriptname}

Set embedded size as 1050x768, and video size as original at 1440x1024

Use CloudBerry to copy to Eucalyptus AWS account, euca-demo bucket, and organize into directory structure TBD.
