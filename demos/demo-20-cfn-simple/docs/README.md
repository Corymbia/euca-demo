# Demo 20: CloudFormation: Simple Procedures

These procedures will run a Demo which uses CloudFormation to create a Security Group and
an Instance.

There are multiple procedures below, identically named except for a suffix which indicates
what method is used to perform the procedure. These include the Eucalyptus Console (-gui),
the Euca2ools CLI (-cli) and the AWS CLI (-awscli). These procedures perform identical
steps using these different methods, showing how multiple AWS ecosystem tools can be used
interchangeably.

Manual procedures do not exist for demo initialization and reset. See the bin directory
for scripts which automate these stages of the demo process.
